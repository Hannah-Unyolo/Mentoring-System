<h1 style="text-align: center;">Born A Crime</h1>
<p>In the first two chapters, we see Trevor sharing his home experience and country’s history, culture, and traditions, which somehow relate to my experience in my country. In 1652, Dutch colonizers came to Cape Town under British rule and gradually developed their own culture and language. They formulated and formalized an advanced system of racial oppression that became known as apartheid. It was an authoritarian state that removed native peoples from their land and forced them into slavery.</p>
<p>Trevor grew up during apartheid, with a white father and a Black mother when sexual relationships between races were against the law. Trevor’s mother, Patricia, took a risk and ran away from home to live and work in Johannesburg when it was illegal for Black people to live within the city limits. We still have the same mentality today, where rich people are the ones who deserve better treatment and services.</p>
<p>Even though Christianity had been forced on native South Africans by the Europeans, Trevor’s mother was a devout Christian who took her family to three churches every Sunday. She was never easily intimidated and her faith in God was unwavering. This is just related to most African homes to be specific to my home. 
</p>
<p>We can also see protection and sacrifice from Trevor’s mother when she throws Trevor out of the bus at an intersection and then jumps out herself. In addition to that, his grandmother used to lock him in the house preventing him from being caught.
